            What Is a Manufacturer's Minimum Advertised Price (MAP) Policy? 
          </h4>
          <p>Definition: A supplier's pricing policy that does not permit its dealers or distributors to advertise prices below some specified amount that they establish.</p>

          <p>Minimum Advertised Price (MAP) is a policy many manufacturers have adopted stipulating the lowest price an item is allowed to be advertised at. If you’ve ever tried to shop around and keep seeing the same price everywhere, you may have found a MAP price. This is why you see notices that say “price too low to advertise” or ask you to request a price quote or ask you to add the product to your shopping cart to see the real discount price. Distributors like CMC Government Supply can incur sizable fines and/or penalties from our vendors for violating their Map policies.</p>

          <p>Quite a few of the manufacturers of products we sell (like ESRI, EOTech, Aimpoint, Beretta, SureFire, Vertx and many others) have a Minimum Advertised Pricing (MAP) policy that requires us to not "advertise" their products for less than the "MAP" price that they establish. This is a required contract term and condition with our vendors for us to resell their products. There is currently no simple mechanism to openly display the correct discounted pricing on our website that falls within the guidelines of our distributor agreements with these manufacturers.</p>

          <h5><strong>Our Simple Pricing Solution:</strong></h5>
          <p>MSRP and MAP Pricing is shown on our website to everyone even though our selling prices may be quite lower (much lower in most cases). We have created a special customer only web site for viewing the REAL DISCOUNT PRICES that we charge our registered customers. This requires our customers to register for FREE online. You only need to register once and NO credit card is required. After that, every time you are logged in to our website, you will see your actual discount pricing without having to request a price quote or add a product to your shopping cart. Once you log in to our customer website and are no longer on our public website our MAP pricing agreements are upheld and you can see the actual discount pricing you will pay when ordering online from CMC Government Supply. You will also see detailed availability information for each item you view. Our website is secure and requires a login and a password for you to enter and see our discount pricing and availability for all of our products. Please feel free to call us if you have any questions about our pricing policies.</p>

          <p>Thank you for your patience and understanding of the rules and policies our vendors have established that we have to follow to offer you our low pricing and great service.</p>

        CMC Government Supply Volume Purchasing Contracts
      </h3>
      <p>
        A CMC Government Supply Volume Purchasing Agreement (VPA) can be custom tailored to any agency need. Our VPA can cover a wide range of equipment for the public safety and first responder communities. There is a guaranteed minimum annual purchase commitment that an agency must purchase to qualify for a Volume Purchasing Agreement.</p>

      <h4>Benefits and Cost Savings of a Volume Purchasing Agreement</h4>
      <p><strong>Product Selection</strong> - The Volume Purchasing Agreement can cover a broad array of public safety equipment, parts & services or a very specific set of approved items for purchase.</p>

      <p><strong>Competitive Pricing</strong> - The Volume Purchasing Agreement can include fixed item pricing or a cost plus pricing based upon annual purchase commitments allowing any agency the ability to save even more.</p>

      <p><strong>Payment Option Savings</strong> – CMC Government Supply offers many different payment options. Each Volume Purchasing Agreement will have the agencies payment option of choice, however, pricing is based on whichever option an agency chooses. Agreement pricing will be based upon agreed payment terms for all purchases. For example, fast payment by direct deposit will earn an agency the maximum savings versus the convenience of payment via purchasing cards that have a higher transaction cost.</p>

      <p><strong>Minimum Order Cost Savings</strong> – The higher the Volume Purchasing Agreement minimum order amount, the lower the pricing.</p>

      <p><strong>Shipping Cost Savings</strong> – There is a cost associated with shipping every order. A CMC Volume Purchasing Agreement can allow an agency to use its carrier of choice and bill their account to earn the maximum product discount we can offer. CMC can also prepay and bill shipping costs to each order. Either way, CMC will process and ship every order quickly.</p>

      <p><strong>Term of the Agreement Administration Savings</strong> – CMC offers one, two and three year Volume Purchasing Agreements depending upon terms and annual purchase commitments.</p>
